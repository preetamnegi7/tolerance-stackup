                    1. What is Tolerance?
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    Tolerance refers to the allowable variation in dimensions and geometry of a manufactured part. It is essential in ensuring that parts fit together correctly and function as intended. Tolerances are specified in design drawings, and can be expressed as a range (e.g., Â±0.1 mm) or as limits (e.g., upper and lower boundaries).

                    2. Why is Tolerance Stackup Important?
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    Tolerance stackup occurs when multiple parts are assembled together, and the accumulated variation in each part's dimensions can impact the final assembly. Properly managing tolerance stackup ensures:

                    3. Types of Tolerance Stackup
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    There are two main types of tolerance stackup: linear and angular.
                </Typography>
                <Typography component="ul">
                    <Typography component="li">a. Linear Stackup: This is the accumulation of dimensional variations in a straight line, such as the length or width of an assembly. It is the most common type of tolerance stackup.</Typography>
                    <Typography component="li">b. Angular Stackup: This occurs when the angular dimensions of parts, such as angles or slopes, accumulate and affect the final assembly.</Typography>

                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    There are two primary methods to perform tolerance stackup analysis:
                </Typography>
                <Typography component="ul">
                    <Typography component="li">a. Worst-Case Analysis: In this method, the maximum and minimum values of each tolerance are combined to determine the largest possible variation in the assembly. This approach is conservative, but it can result in overly tight tolerances and increased production costs.</Typography>
                    <Typography component="li">b. Statistical Analysis: This method uses statistical techniques, such as root sum squares (RSS), to predict the probability of different tolerance combinations. Statistical analysis provides a more accurate representation of real-world scenarios, but it requires more sophisticated calculations and knowledge of probability distributions.</Typography>
